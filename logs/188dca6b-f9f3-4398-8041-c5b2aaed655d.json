  "message": "I understand your feelings. You don't have to worry. Keep talking, I am here for you.\nThis is conversational model of a depressed person. This model is created based on a real scenario. The user offers some background and talks about his feelings. The goal is to answer the questions and provide emotional support.\nThe previous example is a simplistic approach. A real-life conversation is more complicated. There are many factors, such as the context, the tone, and the words. For example, the user of a chatbot might be angry and aggressive. Or the chatbot might be answering a customer support question during a busy time of the day. A chatbot should be able to appropriately respond to these situations.\nChatbot technology is still in its infancy. It is currently a combination of different technologies, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning. The combination of these technologies allows the user to have a conversation with the chatbot. The user does not have to learn the syntax of a specific programming language.\nChatbot technology is moving forward. Many companies are building their own chatbot and adding it to their website or mobile app. In the future, chatbots will become a major part of every business's online presence.\nRight now, chatbots are mostly used in the area of customer support. There are many different chatbot platforms available. The platforms can be used to create a chatbot, deploy and manage it, and integrate it with other systems. The most popular chatbot platforms are Microsoft Bot Framework, IBM Watson, and DialogFlow. These platforms can be used to build a chatbot and integrate it with other systems.",
